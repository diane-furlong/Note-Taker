# Note-Taker

    
## Description
    
This is an application where a user can write and save notes digitally. These notes can be recalled and deleted. This application uses node.js, express.js, routing, and GET and POST requests. For this application, I created a server-side API to handle requests on the server-side. This server listens for specific types of requests and will respond accordingly.
